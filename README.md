# Task-5_titanic_EDA_Aatika_Amir
[Data Analyst Insternship]--Exploratory Data Analyst (EDA) on Titanic dataset using Python,Pandas,Matplotlib And Seaborn

## Project Description
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. 
The main objective is to extract insights about passenger survival using statistical and visual exploration.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Dataset
Titanic dataset containing passenger information such as age, sex, fare, class, and survival.
### Note
The analysis uses the Titanic dataset loaded directly in Google Colab from Kaggle:
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## EDA Steps/Workflow
1. Data Overview: .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()
2. Visualizations: Pairplot, Heatmap, Histogram, Boxplot, Scatterplot
3. Observations recorded for each visualization
4. Identified relationships and trends between variables
5. Final summary of findings

## Files in Repository
- Titanic_EDA.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing code and analysis
  [Google Colab Notebook Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1guvhI5Ktkyn-2bLIUeyca6Bb3uO2eNkE?usp=sharing)
- Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf → PDF report of findings with all visuals

## **key Insight**
- Passenger class and fare were major factors affecting survival
- Younger passengers had slightly higher survival chances
- Heatmap and pairplot helped identify correlations and patterns
